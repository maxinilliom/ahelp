We're also responsible for nearly all the BA records since then. We're competitive when it comes to BXP and prices; we average ~1.4m agility bxp/hr; ~1.9m mining and ~3.5m firemaking and we make sure that our BXP prices reflect the current price of silverhawk feathers so that we're a slightly cheaper alternative.\n\nThere's no learning required at all for customers as we talk people through the entire way through; it's not a problem if you've never played BA before.",
