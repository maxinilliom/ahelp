Players will only be able to open one [sealed clue scroll](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Sealed_clue_scroll) if they do not already have one of the same type active in their inventory or bank.\n\nSealed clue scrolls can also be obtained from Fishing, Mining, Woodcutting, or Divination. The tier of clue scroll players receive is weighted based on their level of the activity, with elites appearing at level 60 training methods and higher. There is always a 1% chance for a sealed elite clue to upgrade to a [sealed master clue](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Sealed_clue_scroll_(master). This can however be boosted to a 2% chance if the invention perk [Prosper](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Prosper) is in use.",
