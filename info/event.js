You must tag <@212672527405678592> in the <#382700826088570880> channel with a screenshot that includes the achievement being completed + your username to receive credit.\n\nThe first player with the most cumulative points will be granted the <@&431238030716698626> title with a color of their choice.\n\nPoints will be assigned based on the [RuneScore](http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/RuneScore) value associated to the completed [achievement](http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Achievements). The title will pass to the next winner during the next update, unless the same individual wins again.\n\nEvery time an Achievement Help member wins the Achievement Champion title for the 10th time, they will be awarded the <@&431238109817208842> title. This title will act in the same way as the former, where the title will pass to the next winner, unless the same individual wins again.\n\nThe <@&436706353856249869> role will be assigned for every event participant, which will be removed and redistributed upon the next event.",
