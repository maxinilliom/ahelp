This rotation will continue until the boss is dead. After every third rotation, The Sanctum Guardian will spawn 2 [Crassian reinforcement](https://runescape.wiki/w/Crassian_reinforcement) minions.\n\nEach water spin will hit the player for roughly 6,500 typless damage. This, along with other damage taken throughout the fight, means a high amount of food is advised. You are able to cycle through [reflect](https://runescape.wiki/w/Reflect), [devotion](https://runescape.wiki/w/Devotion), [debilitate](https://runescape.wiki/w/Debilitate), and [barricade](https://runescape.wiki/w/Barricade) during this achievement to help mitigate damage taken.\n\nPlayers should also be weary of where they place the 3x3 purple corruption square after each rotation, so they do not block themselves in. It is best to place it near where the water attack ends, rather than begins, so the player is not trapped between the two.\n\nThis achievement can not be obtained in story mode.",

Unless he's using another special attack, stand right in front of him, or else your attacks will be delayed and timing will be harder. Use pulverise on the tick after he says **I'll pulverise you**. You should see matching animations of dragging your swords through the ground and the achievement will unlock.",

These stacks are used to reduce Masuta's magic attack in the next phase. With this, ensure you are at least 3 spaces near from any thrashing water that is being attacked. Each water gives 5 stacks, so players must stand next to 13 waters and destroy them. Masuta summons 14-15 waters during phase 2, so there are enough spawns to ensure players can obtain enough stacks.\n\nThis achievement can not be obtained in story mode.",

The horror may be killed once a week after completion of the miniquests, resetting every Wednesday at 00:00 UTC.\n\nZanik's crossbow is both a quest item used during the [The Chosen Commander](https://runescape.wiki/w/The_Chosen_Commander) quest and a [crossbow](https://runescape.wiki/w/Crossbow_(weapon_type) that is the reward for its completion.\n\nBone bolts can be bought on the [Grand Exchange](https://runescape.wiki/w/Grand_Exchange) or from the [Nardok's Bone Weapons](https://runescape.wiki/w/Nardok%27s_Bone_Weapons) shop, run by [Nardok](https://runescape.wiki/w/Nardok) in the [Dorgeshuun Mines](https://runescape.wiki/w/Dorgesh-Kaan_mine), after completing [The Lost Tribe](https://runescape.wiki/w/The_Lost_Tribe) quest.

    "description": "[Best Offence](https://runescape.wiki/w/Best_Offence) is an achievement that requires the player to defeat the [Kalphite King](https://runescape.wiki/w/Kalphite_King) after triggering his [immortality](https://runescape.wiki/w/Immortality) and then defeating him again. The Kalphite King is a boss monster who can be found in the [Exiled Kalphite Hive](https://runescape.wiki/w/Exiled_Kalphite_Hive).\n\n To complete this achievement, players should lower the Kalphite King’s health to around 10-15k lifepoints, after which, the player must wait for him to use a [special attack](https://runescape.wiki/w/Kalphite_King/Strategies#Other_attacks_and_abilities). Once he has finished using a special attack, players will want to utilize the strength [ability](https://runescape.wiki/w/Abilities), [frenzy](https://runescape.wiki/w/Frenzy), or the range ability, [unload](https://runescape.wiki/w/Unload). It is important that the Kalphite King’s health isn’t so low that these attacks result in killing him, thus not triggering his immortality. There is a chance the King will surround itself with a green aura, making it heal instead of taking damage for the duration of the aura. If this occurs, he will not be able to trigger his immortality attack.\n\nIt’s important to note that he can use [barricade](https://runescape.wiki/w/Barricade) instead of immortality, which will negate all damage for 10 seconds and will not work for this achievement. There is also a possibility that he won’t be using anything at all, therefore, it may take a few attempts for this to achievement to complete. After the player does successfully trigger his immortality ability, the King should be killed as fast as the player is able using [thresholds](https://runescape.wiki/w/Category:Threshold_abilities) and [ultimates](https://runescape.wiki/w/Category:Ultimate_abilities).",

Let the Chaos Elemental hit you until it unequips your weapon five times, ensuring to equip it back each time to prepare for the next attack.\n\nRemember the Chaos Elemental is located in the [Wilnderness](https://runescape.wiki/w/Wilderness), so you risk whatever items you choose to bring with you.",

This does not mean you have to avoid 20 waves in a row, just 20 in total. Restarting the fight will restart the counter.\n\nThe Queen Black Dragon is a very powerful dragon slumbering at the bottom of the [Grotworm Lair](https://runescape.wiki/w/Grotworm_Lair). Completing the [Song from the Depths](https://runescape.wiki/w/Song_from_the_Depths#Rewards) reduces incoming damage from the Quenn Black Dragon.\n\nProgress towards the achievement is awarded as the last fire wave of a single special attack reaches the end of the arena platform. The achievement is awarded as soon as twenty fire waves are tallied as avoided - it is not necessary to finish the fight afterwards.\n\nAfter starting the fight, avoid damaging the boss. If you stay on her [first phase](https://runescape.wiki/w/Queen_Black_Dragon/Strategies#Phase_one), she will only spawn one fire wave at a time. This makes it easier to focus and get through one wall at a time, thus lowering the fail-rate and having to restart the count. After successfully making it through all 20 waves, continue the kill as you normally would or simply leave the arena.\n\nThis achievement must be completed during a private [instance](https://runescape.wiki/w/Instance).",

Citizens with an available City Quest will have the symbol of Menaphos above their head and can be found even without Urluk's guidance. A faded quest start marker appears on the city map for active quests.\n\nSimilar to skilling event currencies that are earned automatically, new City Quests become available after players complete a certain number of five-minute playtime triggers. Intervals between City Quests get longer as more are completed, with the number of five-minute triggers needed starting at 1 and capping at 7. The exact triggers are currently unknown, but various skilling activities qualify.

You cannot enter or leave the city by any means other than the fountain located in [Varrock Square](https://runescape.wiki/w/Varrock_Square) or New Varrock Square, respectively.\n\nOn the second set of portals, Zemouregal adds explosive cows as reinforcements. Although they are fairly weak, they explode when they touch Arrav, Zemouregal, or a portal, dealing 1,500 damage, which instantly destroys portals. When Zemouregal has 1/3rd of his life points left, he starts summoning a large amount of protection portals and explosive cows. Lure the cows into the portals to destroy as many of them as you can. Once all of the portals are destroyed, explosive cows continually appear until Zemouregal is killed. When dodging cows, be mindful of the fact that accidentally running onto the stairs to the north will reset the entire battle with no warning whatsoever.",

    "description": "[Berries of the Arc](https://runescape.wiki/w/Berrys_of_the_Arc) is an achievement that requires the player to discover all of the [Arc Berries](https://runescape.wiki/w/The_Arc/Berries) throughout [The Arc](https://runescape.wiki/w/The_Arc) region.\n\nBerry bushes can be grown from seed in the planters on [Tuai Leit](https://runescape.wiki/w/Tuai_Leit) In order to obtain any berry besides rumberries and exuberries, players need to either find a seed in a rare [Uncharted Isles](https://runescape.wiki/w/Uncharted_Isles) chest or cross-breed them in the planters in central Tuai Leit.\n\nPlayers can add one seed to each of the adjacent planters in order to cross-pollinate seeds and grow bushes. After approximately 42 hours of growth, bushes will mature and can be harvested for berries and seeds. Unlike real seeds that only produce pollen after flowering, berry seeds will cross-pollinate if they are planted next to each other - even before any significant growth shows. Therefore, harvesting one bush and immediately planting a new seed - before harvesting the second bush - will ensure that each harvest may yield a new cross-pollinated seed along with the regular produce.\n\nPlayers do not require 86 Farming to plant or harvest berry bushes, only to obtain the rumberry and exuberry seeds initially from bushes. However, harvesting berries without 86 Farming will receive no Farming experience. Players may alternatively receive them from catching a [foraging bakami](https://runescape.wiki/w/Foraging_bakami), but catching one requires 90 Hunter.",

Simply click the **Squire ('Travel')**. Alternatively, you can right-click and speak with the [Squire](https://runescape.wiki/w/Squire_(Void_Knights) and she will ask if you want to go to the [Void Knights' Outpost](https://runescape.wiki/w/Void_Knights%27_Outpost).\n\nPlayers must use the logs that are on the beach within Pest Control as logs brought from the outside world will not work. Barricades can be destroyed by allowing [Ravagers](https://runescape.wiki/w/Ravager) and [Splatters](https://runescape.wiki/w/Splatter) to destroy them. You do not need to repair every single barrier, you only need to repair the ones which have been damaged.

This minigame can be started by talking to [Osman](https://runescape.wiki/w/Osman) (or [Emir Ali Mirza](https://runescape.wiki/w/Emir_Ali_Mirza) after [Our Man in the North](https://runescape.wiki/w/Our_Man_in_the_North)).\n\nThe player has to start right beyond the entrance gate and pick a fruit from the tree without stopping. Running is imperative. Players may find it easiest to achieve on the [Winter Garden](https://runescape.wiki/w/Sorceress%27s_Garden/Winter) as it's the least troublesome of the four gardens.\n\nWhen you see the spirit, click on the sq’irk tree and let your character do the running.

The seeds must be dug up and not flagged.\n\nPlayers can get to the minigame from almost any farming patch with a [Tool Leprechaun](https://runescape.wiki/w/Tool_leprechaun) wandering around. Simply right-click him or her and click 'teleport' and request to be teleported to the minigame. He will then say [Avach nimporto](https://runescape.wiki/w/Avach_nimporto) and you will find yourself at the minigame site. There is a [portal](https://runescape.wiki/w/Portal) northeast of the farmhouse to return to the patch. [Familiars](https://runescape.wiki/w/Summoning_familiars) and [pets](https://runescape.wiki/w/Pet) cannot be brought into the minigame.\n\nThe game involves a grid of holes. After digging at a hole with a spade a number will appear at the digging location. The number indicates the number of adjacent squares that hold a seed. The numbers range from zero to seven.\n• 0 is invisible\n• 1 is blue\n• 2 is green\n• 3 is red\n• 4 is yellow\n• 5 is purple\n• 6 is teal\n• 7 is very light brown\n\nIn case of a zero, the minigame will show an empty area. If the edge of the empty area is close enough the numbers on the edge will be displayed instantly too. Digging at a location that carries a seed destroys the seed.\n\nTo complete the requirement, speak to [Farmer Blinkin](https://runescape.wiki/w/Farmer_Blinkin) or [Mrs. Winkin](https://runescape.wiki/w/Mrs._Winkin) and claim a free [flag](https://runescape.wiki/w/Flag). Head south and begin digging up the field. The trick is the dig around until you see some number 3's, then dig around it for the seed. Repeat 12 times.",

In total, there are 14 [beacons](https://runescape.wiki/w/All_Fired_Up_(minigame) in the beacon network, with each beacon requiring 20 un-noted logs of choice to light. This achievement can easily be accomplished by pre-loading all beacons besides the final one. These logs will not disappear. This event is timed based on the type of log used and the time the first beacon is list.

The horror may be killed once a week after completion of the miniquests, resetting every Wednesday at 00:00 UTC.\n\nFor every 12,500 damage dealt to the Skeletal Horror an appendage will be thrown to a corner of the battlefield. First the [right arm](https://runescape.wiki/w/Arm_(right) will fall off, then the [left arm](https://runescape.wiki/w/Arm_(left), and finally the [tail](https://runescape.wiki/w/Tail).\n\nWhen an appendage is lost the skeletal horror will become weakened; lowering the combat level, the max hit, accuracy, and defensive capabilities of the skeletal horror. The appendages must be picked up into the player's [inventory](https://runescape.wiki/w/Inventory) and buried. If left on the ground or in your inventory, the appendage will reattach to the Skeletal horror, healing back the damage dealt, and restoring its combat stats.\n\nIt is possible, albeit difficult to kill the skeletal horror without burying any of the appendages.\n\nThe skeletal horror can be dangerous if unprepared, or for lower level players. It will not attack you with the attack style that you are praying against (e.g., if praying against Magic, it will use Melee, and vice versa), so high healing food such as [monkfish](https://runescape.wiki/w/Monkfish) or [sharks](https://runescape.wiki/w/Shark) are recommended. It is not recommended to use armor below level 70 to fight the skeletal horror as it can hit exceptionally high if you do. A high levelled player should be able to defeat the skeletal horror without any issue.",

The RuneScape celtic knot puzzle consists of three loops, each one a different color and with a different sequence of 16 [runestones](https://runescape.wiki/w/Runes).",

Try another intersection combination\n• Players can deduce what runes can and cannot be possibilities by looking carefully at the knots and using the following guidelines:\n\t• If a particular type of rune appears on only one of the three knots, that rune type cannot be a possibility for any of the intersections and can be completely eliminated altogether\n\t• If a particular type of rune appears on two of the three knots, that rune is only a possibililty for the intersection of the two knots it appears on, and not at any of the intersections with the knot it does not appear on\n• While doing Celtic knots, the clockwise rotation may not be needed by experienced players. Always remember to use the Invert paths so you can tell what runes are on the knot that is being covered in and saves time. "

    "description": "[Around the World in Six Ways](https://runescape.wiki/w/Around_the_World_in_Six_Ways) is an achievement that requires the player to go to each destination using the [Balloon transport system](https://runescape.wiki/w/Balloon_transport_system) after [Enlightened Journey](https://runescape.wiki/w/Enlightened_Journey).\n\nThe Balloon Transport System or Hot Air Balloon is one of several transportation modes in RuneScape.\n\nAfter completing the Enlightened Journey quest, a player can travel between [Entrana](https://runescape.wiki/w/Entrana) and [Taverley](https://runescape.wiki/w/Taverley). To unlock the 4 new routes, a player must first start from Entrana with the required new logs, and navigate successfully through 3 screens to a new destination. Crashing the balloon will result in the loss of the remaining logs, and the need to start again in Entrana with a new set of logs. Once a destination is unlocked, players may travel there from any other unlocked location, using fewer logs, and without navigating the 3 screens.\n\nThe player may not carry over 40 kilograms of weight when using the balloon. You can use [weight reducing clothing](https://runescape.wiki/w/Weight-reducing_clothing) to carry what would otherwise weigh more than 40 kg. This weight limit does not include the log used to make the journey.",

It is available to both free-to-play and members, however can only be participated in using the NXT client. The first 9 locations are available to all players, and the last 7 locations are exclusive to members.\n\nThe event can be started by talking to [Benedict](https://runescape.wiki/w/Benedict), who can be found in the building near Charlie the Tramp, just north-west of the Varrock lodestone. Benedict will ask the player to help find his lost items across [Gielinor](https://runescape.wiki/w/Gielinor). He will give the player a [scrapbook](https://runescape.wiki/w/Scrapbook), which provides an image clue for each item.\n\nTo complete the mini-event, the player has to find each item. Each item has a loot beam shining over it, and can be found in locations that show-off the benefits of the NXT client.",

    "description": "[Deadlier Catch](https://runescape.wiki/w/Deadlier_Catch) is an achievement that requires the player to hunt the [Thalassus](https://runescape.wiki/w/Thalassus) another ten times after completion of [Deadliest Catch](https://runescape.wiki/w/Deadliest_Catch).\n\nThalassus is a massive fish that originates from the [Wushanko Isles](https://runescape.wiki/w/Wushanko_Isles) and is featured in the Deadliest Catch quest.\n\nTo begin these hunts, talk to [Jones](https://runescape.wiki/w/Jones) outside the bank in the [Fishing Guild](https://runescape.wiki/w/Fishing_Guild). During the last three hunts, the sea wind will blow and disorient the player, rotating the camera's viewpoint. Players can easily correct for this by rotating back to face north. Once it has been hunted ten times, Thalassus will flee to another part of the sea and is unable to be hunted again.\n\nIf the player turns their run energy off then no energy will be consumed. During the activity, 'The Guns' energy is equal to the player's run energy. The [Oo'glog](https://runescape.wiki/w/Oo%27glog) salt-water spring [spa](https://runescape.wiki/w/Spa) can be used for 10–25 minutes of practically infinite energy for 'The Guns' to use.\n\nWhile the path changes for each hunt, the location of the shipwrecks is fixed. [This blank map](https://runescape.wiki/w/File:Thallasus_map.png) may be used as an easier way to track down the Thalassus. It is recommended to mark each shipwreck which leads the player along the trail.",

    "description": "[Fancy turtle-back](https://runescape.wiki/w/Fancy_turtle-back) is an achievement requiring the player to interact with the [treasure turtle](https://runescape.wiki/w/Treasure_turtle) that may occasionally appear at the [Deep Sea Fishing hub](https://runescape.wiki/w/Deep_Sea_Fishing_hub). If a player was on the same world as the treasure turtle when it spawned, it will also reward the player with a clue scroll reward. The possible items are chosen from the Treasure Trail reward tables, up to Elite level. The reward provided uses similar mechanics to the Giant Oyster D&D. Thus, wearing a [luck of the dwarves](https://runescape.wiki/w/Luck_of_the_dwarves) will increase the likelihood of better rewards. You must be in the area when the event starts to be eligible for the full rewards.\n\nThe best way to complete this achievement is by fishing in world 116, the official Deep Sea fishing world, or by searching for friends to accompany you either in this discord or the **whirpooldnd** friend's chat.",

This method does not gain any fish, but it will give plenty of experience. It is possible to achieve the highest fishing experience per hour in game using this method. Continuously fishing gives a streak bonus of +1% xp boost for every 10 catches (up to 20% xp boost with a soft cap of 200 streak). The streak will be halved if the player is inactive for 6 seconds, but it will not decrease further until another fish is flung and inactivity is reached again. Success rate depends on the player's Fishing level, with up to a maximum of 100% success rate at level 99.",
