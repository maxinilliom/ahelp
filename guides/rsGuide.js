This rotation will continue until the boss is dead. After every third rotation, The Sanctum Guardian will spawn 2 [Crassian reinforcement](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Crassian_reinforcement) minions.\n\nEach water spin will hit the player for roughly 6,500 typless damage. This, along with other damage taken throughout the fight, means a high amount of food is advised. You are able to cycle through [reflect](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Reflect), [devotion](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Devotion), [debilitate](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Debilitate), and [barricade](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Barricade) during this achievement to help mitigate damage taken.\n\nPlayers should also be weary of where they place the 3x3 purple corruption square after each rotation, so they do not block themselves in. It is best to place it near where the water attack ends, rather than begins, so the player is not trapped between the two.\n\nThis achievement can not be obtained in story mode.",

Unless he's using another special attack, stand right in front of him, or else your attacks will be delayed and timing will be harder. Use pulverise on the tick after he says **I'll pulverise you**.

These stacks are used to reduce Masuta's magic attack in the next phase. With this, ensure you are at least 3 spaces near from any thrashing water that is being attacked. Each water gives 5 stacks, so players must stand next to 13 waters and destroy them. Masuta summons 14-15 waters during phase 2, so there are enough spawns to ensure players can obtain enough stacks.\n\nThis achievement can not be obtained in story mode.",

The horror may be killed once a week after completion of the miniquests, resetting every Wednesday at 00:00 UTC.\n\nZanik's crossbow is both a quest item used during the [The Chosen Commander](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/The_Chosen_Commander) quest and a [crossbow](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Crossbow_(weapon_type) that is the reward for its completion.\n\nBone bolts can be bought on the [Grand Exchange](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Grand_Exchange) or from the [Nardok's Bone Weapons](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Nardok%27s_Bone_Weapons) shop, run by [Nardok](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Nardok) in the [Dorgeshuun Mines](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Dorgesh-Kaan_mine), after completing [The Lost Tribe](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/The_Lost_Tribe) quest.

    "description": "[Best Offence](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Best_Offence) is an achievement that requires the player to defeat the [Kalphite King](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Kalphite_King) after triggering his [immortality](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Immortality) and then defeating him again. The Kalphite King is a boss monster who can be found in the [Exiled Kalphite Hive](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Exiled_Kalphite_Hive).\n\n To complete this achievement, players should lower the Kalphite King’s health to around 10-15k lifepoints, after which, the player must wait for him to use a [special attack](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Kalphite_King/Strategies#Other_attacks_and_abilities). Once he has finished using a special attack, players will want to utilize the strength [ability](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Abilities), [frenzy](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Frenzy), or the range ability, [unload](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Unload). It is important that the Kalphite King’s health isn’t so low that these attacks result in killing him, thus not triggering his immortality. There is a chance the King will surround itself with a green aura, making it heal instead of taking damage for the duration of the aura. If this occurs, he will not be able to trigger his immortality attack.\n\nIt’s important to note that he can use [barricade](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Barricade) instead of immortality, which will negate all damage for 10 seconds and will not work for this achievement. There is also a possibility that he won’t be using anything at all, therefore, it may take a few attempts for this to achievement to complete. After the player does successfully trigger his immortality ability, the King should be killed as fast as the player is able using [thresholds](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Threshold_abilities) and [ultimates](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Ultimate_abilities).",

However, it needs to be four **unique** hits from asphyxiate. That is, if the stunner asphyxiates and only the first, second, and fourth damage placers hit during the attack, then the attack must be used again, ensuring the third hit lands successfully.\n\nIf more than one asphyxiate is required, the jelly wrangler should handle the second intercept and barricade for the stunner."

This does not mean you have to avoid 20 waves in a row, just 20 in total. Restarting the fight will restart the counter.\n\nThe Queen Black Dragon is a very powerful dragon slumbering at the bottom of the [Grotworm Lair](http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Grotworm_Lair). Completing the [Song from the Depths](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Song_from_the_Depths#Rewards) reduces incoming damage from the Quenn Black Dragon.\n\nProgress towards the achievement is awarded as the last fire wave of a single special attack reaches the end of the arena platform. The achievement is awarded as soon as twenty fire waves are tallied as avoided - it is not necessary to finish the fight afterwards.\n\nAfter starting the fight, avoid damaging the boss. If you stay on her [first phase](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Queen_Black_Dragon/Strategies#Phase_one), she will only spawn one fire wave at a time. This makes it easier to focus and get through one wall at a time, thus lowering the fail-rate and having to restart the count. After successfully making it through all 20 waves, continue the kill as you normally would or simply leave the arena.\n\nThis achievement must be completed during a private [instance](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Instance).",

Citizens with an available City Quest will have the symbol of Menaphos above their head and can be found even without Urluk's guidance. A faded quest start marker appears on the city map for active quests.\n\nSimilar to skilling event currencies that are earned automatically, new City Quests become available after players complete a certain number of five-minute playtime triggers. Intervals between City Quests get longer as more are completed, with the number of five-minute triggers needed starting at 1 and capping at 7. The exact triggers are currently unknown, but various skilling activities qualify.

If you die, you will lose your items and will need to [reclaim](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Items_Kept_on_Death) them from [Death](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Death) or your [grave](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Gravestone).**\n\nCorrupted Scarabs may appear around [Shifting Tombs](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Shifting_Tombs) entrances in Menaphos, at the mine in the [worker district](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Worker_district), and periodically outside the [Sophanem Slayer Dungeon](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Sophanem_Slayer_Dungeon). They may also be found in the [treasure chests](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Shifting_Tombs#Looting_treasure_chests) in Shifting Tombs. They can be burst to gain a small amount of [reputation](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Menaphos/Reputation) and a high amount of Slayer experience. However, this also deals damage to the player that varies based on their Constitution level.\n\nIf multiple players click the same scarab, they will all be able to burst it, even if one player clicks later and the scarab has already been burst showing the splatter animation where it was.\n\nWhen scarabs spawn in a world, there is a game message: **Agitated scarabs have burrowed up onto the surface and are spreading corruption!**\n\nOnce the scarab mob is depleted, players may refresh it by entering into the Shifting Tombs entrance and exiting it once again. Players may receive double the killcount/experience by left clicking the scarab to burst it, right clicking, and selecting the burst option after the initial burst experience drop has occurred.\n\n Scarab locations are often called in the **soulobby** friend's chat.",

Although they are fairly weak, they explode when they touch Arrav, Zemouregal, or a portal, dealing 1,500 damage, which instantly destroys portals. When Zemouregal has 1/3rd of his life points left, he starts summoning a large amount of protection portals and explosive cows. Lure the cows into the portals to destroy as many of them as you can.

After approximately 42 hours of growth, bushes will mature and can be harvested for berries and seeds. Unlike real seeds that only produce pollen after flowering, berry seeds will cross-pollinate if they are planted next to each other - even before any significant growth shows. Therefore, harvesting one bush and immediately planting a new seed - before harvesting the second bush - will ensure that each harvest may yield a new cross-pollinated seed along with the regular produce.\n\nPlayers do not require 86 Farming to plant or harvest berry bushes, only to obtain the rumberry and exuberry seeds initially from bushes. However, harvesting berries without 86 Farming will receive no Farming experience. Players may alternatively receive them from catching a [foraging bakami](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Foraging_bakami), but catching one requires 90 Hunter.",

Simply click the **Squire ('Travel')**. Alternatively, you can right-click and speak with the [Squire](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Squire_(Void_Knights) and she will ask if you want to go to the [Void Knights' Outpost](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Void_Knights%27_Outpost).\n\nPlayers must use the logs that are on the beach within Pest Control as logs brought from the outside world will not work. Barricades can be destroyed by allowing [Ravagers](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Ravager) and [Splatters](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Splatter) to destroy them. You do not need to repair every single barrier, you only need to repair the ones which have been damaged.

This is best attempted **off** [spotlight](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Thaler) due to how quickly games end during spotlight.

It is located south-west of the bank, and west of the abandoned mausoleum. After going through the [portal](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Portal), the player will arrive at [Nomad](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Nomad)'s camp.\n\nNote that the Soul Obelisk must be captured by the team of the player who is attempting to deposit their soul fragements. This is completed simply by the team seeking to control it having more people in the surrounding area of the obelisk. In order for another player to score for the achievement, the opposing teams avatar, either the [Avatar of Creation](http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Avatar_of_Creation) or [Avatar of Destruction](http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Avatar_of_Destruction), must die before the next player can deposit their 100 soul fragments.\n\nSoul Wars requires 10 players to begin a game. This is best attempted **on** [spotlight](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Thaler), however, you will have to compete with everyone else who is trying to complete the achievement at the same time, as only so many players can score per game. You may also tag the <@&451411977894494212> role to try to find assistance for this achievement, however it is unlikely to occur due to the team size required.",

Simply right-click him or her and click 'teleport' and request to be teleported to the minigame.

It can be found in the east of [Brimhaven](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Brimhaven), and is run by [Cap'n Izzy No-Beard](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Cap%27n_Izzy_No-Beard) who charges 200 [coins](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Coins) for admission. If players have completed [Rocking Out](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Rocking_Out), they will be allowed to enter free of charge. Although there is no official world, many players choose to do this minigame on worlds 2, 6, or 71, because the number of people generates more fun and enjoyment than doing the arena on an empty world.\n\nYou do not need to tag every pillar consecutively, just touch 30 pillars at any time during your session. It is recommended to proceed back to the middle of the arena once a pillar has been tagged so you can reach all corners of the arena more quickly when the next pillar can be tagged. Logging out or switching worlds will cause your progress to be reset.",

Players are given a filled 5x5 box of the icons of three combat styles (melee, Magic and Ranged). In order to solve the puzzle, the whole grid must be filled with only one combat style. Clicking on the combat styles will rotate between the three icons in an area of effect similar to the [Flip tiles](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Dungeoneering/Puzzles#Flip_tiles) puzzle in Dungeoneering. Unlike the puzzle, the icons cannot be forced. Follow these steps to solve the puzzle:\n\n• Solve the first four rows by using the next row (so for the first row, use the second row)\n• Look at the bottom row for the one you want to change and click the tile in the first row of the same column\n• Solve the first row by clicking on the second row\n• Do this until only the bottom one is unsolved\n\nTo solve the last row, certain mutations can be applied to the whole puzzle. The [wiki tables](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Treasure_Trails/Guide/Lockboxes) give frequently encountered puzzles and their solution (which tiles to click how many times).",

The horror may be killed once a week after completion of the miniquests, resetting every Wednesday at 00:00 UTC.\n\nFor every 12,500 damage dealt to the Skeletal Horror an appendage will be thrown to a corner of the battlefield. First the [right arm](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Arm_(right) will fall off, then the [left arm](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Arm_(left), and finally the [tail](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Tail).\n\nWhen an appendage is lost the skeletal horror will become weakened; lowering the combat level, the max hit, accuracy, and defensive capabilities of the skeletal horror. The appendages must be picked up into the player's [inventory](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Inventory) and buried. If left on the ground or in your inventory, the appendage will reattach to the Skeletal horror, healing back the damage dealt, and restoring its combat stats.\n\nIt is possible, albeit difficult to kill the skeletal horror without burying any of the appendages.\n\nThe skeletal horror can be dangerous if unprepared, or for lower level players.

Clue scrolls can be randomly dropped by various [monsters](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Bestiary), found while pickpocketing [H.A.M.

Players will only be able to open one [sealed clue scroll](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Sealed_clue_scroll) if they do not already have one of the same type active in their inventory or bank.\n\nSealed clue scrolls can also be obtained from Fishing, Mining, Woodcutting, or Divination. The tier of clue scroll players receive is weighted based on their level of the activity, with elites appearing at level 60 training methods and higher. There is always a 1% chance for a sealed elite clue to upgrade to a [sealed master clue](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Sealed_clue_scroll_(master). This can however be boosted to a 2% chance if the invention perk [Prosper](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Prosper) is in use.",

Always remember to use the Invert paths so you can tell what runes are on the knot that is being covered in and saves time. "

To unlock the 4 new routes, a player must first start from Entrana with the required new logs, and navigate successfully through 3 screens to a new destination. Crashing the balloon will result in the loss of the remaining logs, and the need to start again in Entrana with a new set of logs. Once a destination is unlocked, players may travel there from any other unlocked location, using fewer logs, and without navigating the 3 screens.\n\nThe player may not carry over 40 kilograms of weight when using the balloon. You can use [weight reducing clothing](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Weight-reducing_clothing) to carry what would otherwise weigh more than 40 kg. This weight limit does not include the log used to make the journey.",

During the last three hunts, the sea wind will blow and disorient the player, rotating the camera's viewpoint. Players can easily correct for this by rotating back to face north. Once it has been hunted ten times, Thalassus will flee to another part of the sea and is unable to be hunted again.\n\nIf the player turns their run energy off then no energy will be consumed. During the activity, 'The Guns' energy is equal to the player's run energy. The [Oo'glog](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Oo%27glog) salt-water spring [spa](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Spa) can be used for 10–25 minutes of practically infinite energy for 'The Guns' to use.\n\nWhile the path changes for each hunt, the location of the shipwrecks is fixed. [This blank map](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/File:Thallasus_map.png) may be used as an easier way to track down the Thalassus. It is recommended to mark each shipwreck which leads the player along the trail.",

Vyre corpses stack in both the inventory and bank so players will find they can stay longer while killing them as their [inventory](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Inventory) does not fill up with individual corpses.\n\nThe fastest way to reach the Columbarium is by using a [ring of slaying](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Ring_of_slaying) to teleport to the [Slayer Tower](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Slayer_Tower), and running to the [Paterdomus temple](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Paterdomus) or using fairy ring **c•k•s** which will bring you just southeast of the bridge near the trapdoor entrance to the temple.\n\nKills completed by using [Sunspear](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Sunspear) or any of its reformed versions DO NOT count towards the total.\n\nThis also upgrades [blisterwood weapons](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Blisterwood#Weapons).",

Players must then add them to the [Scabaras research](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Scabaras_research) before handing it in to [Lead archaeologist Abigail](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Lead_archaeologist_Abigail). This can only be done after [Dealing with Scabaras](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Dealing_with_Scabaras).\n\nThe Scabaras research book has 24 pages and it is full when the player has found all 19 notes. Pages 1, 18 and 24 are blank. **Two of the notes are exclusively found in the [Scabarite hive](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Scabarite_Hive_dungeon) within treasure chests.**\n\nTrying to 'Copy to log' a papyrus note that has already been copied with give the message: 'You already have this information in your logbook.' However, the note will disappear from the player's inventory. There are 19 different types of scabarite notes to collect, each with a different examine text.\n\nIt's possible that the notes are much more common if you have a scabarite slayer task whilst killing the scabarites in the [swamp](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/File:Ullek_map.png). The notes are far more common when killing the scabaras and locusts compared to the skeletons. A good spot for this is the most north-eastern corner of the scabaras swamp where a cannon can be placed.",

There are 6 different diseases with different symptoms. Players will have to correctly identify the animal's disease and cure it to gain Farming experience. To do this players must examine different parts of the animal, such as the mouth, eyes, legs, and stomach, to gain information about symptoms. From this, the player can identify the correct disease and create a potion cure. Animals cannot die from a disease, their stats are lowered instead. Using the incorrect treatment would result in lowering the animals' stats further.\n\nDifferent livestock can be obtained via hunter, combat, or summoning, [Granny Potterington](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Granny_Potterington)'s [Farmers' Market](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Farmers%27_Market), and from the [Grand Exchange](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Grand_Exchange).\n\nPlayers will require at least a small [pen](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Player-owned_farm#Pens) in order to store animals in for them to become diseased.",

Once the produce is gathered from the elder stage, the chinchompa will no longer have a chance in exploding.\n\nIf the player chooses to buy their chinchompa from another player, it is best to only buy baby chinchompas, as this gives more chances on making it explode.\n\nThis achievement can be done with any chinchompa, however, it is recommended to use the most common breeds, as you will lose your chinchompa upon it exploding. The breeds of chinchompas are:\n• [Grey chinchompa](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Grey_chinchompa)\n• [Carnivorous chinchompa](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Carnivorous_chinchompa_%28Player-owned_farm%29)\n• [Cobalt chinchompa](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Cobalt_chinchompa)\n• [Viridian chinchompa](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Viridian_chinchompa)\n• [Azure chinchompa](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Azure_chinchompa)\n• [Crimson chinchompa](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Crimson_chinchompa)\n• [Crystal chinchompa](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Crystal_chinchompa)\n• [Golden chinchompa](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Golden_chinchompa_(Player-owned_farm)\n\nChinchompas can initially be obtained by hunting [Chinchompas](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Chinchompa), [Red chinchompas](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Red_chinchompa), or [Skillchompas](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Skillchompa), or bought from other players.
