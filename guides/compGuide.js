These must be done in order, although it is possible to do all at once. It is not possible to complete the third challenge without completing the first and second in the same or on a previous playthrough.\n\nThe challenges are:\n\n• Complete a replay without dying (try to always peek foggy doors and move very quickly in purple rooms)\n• Complete a replay without dying using one or less healing item (save your one piece for when your health drops to 500 or when it drops to 200 in purple room)\n• Complete a replay in under 37 minutes and complete both other challenges (the [quick guide](https://runescape.wiki/w/Broken_Home/Quick_guide) can help with this - try to memorise what direction your next door will be to stay ahead)",

They can be checked by talking to Commander Comrad at the Barbarian Outpost.\n\nAfter each wave is complete, the player will receive a number of Honour points based on their team's performance in battle. The team members will be presented with an interface indicating the amount of points awarded to the individual and to which role, the player will also have the choice to level up in that role if he or she has the required amount of points to do so. After completion of the 10th wave you will receive 80 points in your current role and 5 in the others. Upon completing the 10th wave you will be automatically reset to wave 1.",

Profound equipment can be purchased using [Gold Castle Wars tickets]( https://runescape.wiki/w/Castle_wars_ticket_(gold), [Thaler]( https://runescape.wiki/w/Thaler), or a mixture of both.\n\nThis is one of the most time-consuming achievements in the game, taking up to 795 hours to complete by playing only [Spotlighted minigames]( https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=42brp3b48aumm199hord137gh0@group.calendar.google.com) or playing 20 minute Castle Wars games with a 100% win rate (accounting for the 3 minute wait time between games). Even using the fastest methods, playing on spotlight and/or Minigames Weekend, and using [Castle wars token enhancers](https://runescape.wiki/w/Castle_wars_token_enhancer), it will take at least 300 hours to complete. It is generally considered to be the longest and most onerous requirement for the trimmed completionist cape. However, using only Thaler, this achievement can be completed without playing a single game of Castle Wars.\n\n**It is highly advised to do this with a Castle Wars or Thaler community.**\n\n• You may find a Castle Wars community at [this discord](https://discord.gg/hzvwrvX) or at friend-chat **Cwar United**.

Do not use a [legendary pet](https://runescape.wiki/w/Category:Legendary_pets) to pick up the cores, as those cores will not count toward the 15 required.\n\n Boosts can be used to receive this lamp and complete the achievement.\n\n This achievement has no progress indicator, so it is recommended to keep the cores in the bank to determine which cores are left to do.\n\nWhen the player can claim the lamp and complete the achievement, they will receive the chat message \"You've collected enough of a variety of shadow cores that Lord Amlodd would like to reward you.\"\n\nThe title of this task is misleading, players do not have to cleanse the cores.\n\nPlayers may need to talk to Lord Amlodd before the achievement will complete, asking about \"Amlodd Skills\". If players have already picked up 15 of each core before talking to Lord Amlodd, they may need to get 1 more core as a drop to force the achievement to complete.",

To enter the circus, players have to get a [Circus ticket](https://runescape.wiki/w/Circus_ticket) from a [Ticket vendor](https://runescape.wiki/w/Ticket_vendor). The location of the Ticket Vendor changes all the time. The exact location of one of those vendors can be found on your map by indicating a [yellow Quest symbol](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/runescape2/images/0/07/D%26D_map_icon.png/revision/latest?cb=20160223204246). To exit, they just have to tear the ticket, teleport, or log out.\n\nThese [costumes](https://runescape.wiki/w/Balthazar_Beauregard%27s_Big_Top_Bonanza#Circus_costumes) can be gained through getting points in [performances](https://runescape.wiki/w/Balthazar_Beauregard%27s_Big_Top_Bonanza#Performances). Repeating any trick will not result in more experience so you need to work through different tricks. This is different from the way Circus score is earned, where players can repeatedly perform the same high-level trick to increase their score, as long as they take measures, such as doing an emote between each trick, to ensure they do not become boring. Therefore players wishing to maximise their experience gain do so at the expense of their Circus score.\n\nTo get the lower level costumes, you will need to get their score range needed as going above will roll you a no reward if you have all rewards of the higher tier. With this being the case, it would be beneficial to attempt for the Ringmaster outfit first so failed attempts are still rewarding.",

Be aware, however, that the cave will slowly fill with lava, submerging the safespots and forcing the player to use the low wall in the middle of the area for luring. Lava will fill the cave after waves 10, 20, 30 and 34. By the time the final boss fight with Har-Aken commences, only a square-shaped piece of land will be available.\n\nEvery alternate wave will also cause [lava crystals](https://runescape.wiki/w/Lava_crystal) to spawn in the Kiln, which can be used to gain bonuses such as temporary invincibility or full prayer and life point restoration.

The blood mirage heals its fellow mirages for up to 900 life points each for each attack it performs, regardless if it hits the player or not. The healing only applies to the mirages that it was summoned with, so it will not heal mirages of another camel. The shadow mirage has an adrenaline bar over its head, which fills as it attacks. When completely filled, it will launch a curse at the player that drains a massive amount of your prayer points. It can also perform [Weaken](https://runescape.wiki/w/Weaken) on the player.

If the blood mirage breaks free and the remaining mirage is not killed yet, bind it again.\n\nThe camel will appear again at the location of the last mirage killed. Throughout the fight with the main camel, a bar will appear above its head, similar to the shadow mirage.

It can be easily avoided though, so stunning and binding them is recommended if you need to kill it quickly.\n\nCamel Warriors have an unusual weakness mechanic. While they are weak to crushing attacks, (melee) themselves, their mirages are weak to thrown attacks (ranged).

Only one light vine needs to be cut to reach the inner ring, and only the inner ring of medium and dense vines needs to be cleared.\n\nIt is possible to reach the overgrown idol by using the portal at the [Max Guild](https://runescape.wiki/w/Max_Guild).",

Most of the mechanics are the same as in the normal fight but there are a few additional mechanics, especially in the final phase. There are also no checkpoints, so all four phases must be completed in one go.\n\nA [deathtouch dart](https://runescape.wiki/w/Deathtouch_dart) only kills one phase and is recommended only if players struggle on the last phase.\n\nThe arena cannot be teleported from, but during the first three phases the fight can be exited by using the stairs at the entrance near the south side of the arena.

If the clone is killed, Nomad will use his discarded abilities again until the end of this phase. If the player defeats the real Nomad, the next phase starts automatically. Usually, the real Nomad is the one that appears on the bridge; the one at the end of the bridge is usually the clone.

If the player has Deflect Melee active, Nomad will occasionally say \"You're alone here [player]\", disabling it and preventing it from being re-activated for a few seconds. During this phase, it is crucial to re-activate Deflect Melee as soon as possible, and while it is deactivated, reduce damage using Resonance, Debilitate, Reflect, and even [Barricade](https://runescape.wiki/w/Barricade), as without prayer, it is possible that Nomad can deal damage faster than the player can heal."

The room containing all the loot can be accessed by entering a tunnel in Movario's study. Movario's base contains 100 of each of the following; [coal](https://runescape.wiki/w/Coal), [death runes](https://runescape.wiki/w/Death_rune), [fire runes](https://runescape.wiki/w/Fire_rune), and [magic logs](https://runescape.wiki/w/Magic_logs). A player can [dissassemble](https://runescape.wiki/w/Disassemble) the magic logs and coal to complete the achievement in one trip, or use a [beast of burden](https://runescape.wiki/w/Beast_of_Burden) and a [Coal Bag](https://runescape.wiki/w/Coal_bag).\n\nThe entrance to the base is in a ruined building on the Khazard [Battlefield](https://runescape.wiki/w/Battlefield). The building can be entered by climbing the broken wall. The quickest way to get to the base is to use a [Spirit tree](https://runescape.wiki/w/Spirit_tree) to go to the battlefield. Other practical options are to use an [Ardougne teleport](https://runescape.wiki/w/Ardougne_teleport), an [Ourania Teleport](https://runescape.wiki/w/Ourania_Teleport) from the [Lunar spells](https://runescape.wiki/w/Lunar_spells), or [Fairy ring](https://runescape.wiki/w/Fairy_ring) code **d•j•p** to the [Tower of Life](https://runescape.wiki/w/Tower_of_Life_(building%29).",

It is also revealed that he used the furs from Fur 'n' Seek to make himself a new outfit. The player then defeats the Skeletal Horror, freeing the Odd Old Man from its control. Afterwards, the old man sets about rebuilding the monster for research purposes and invites the player to return once a week to ensure the beast is kept under control.\n\n• None of the bone drops are 100%, but they are fairly common.\n• No more than 40 kills should be required for any special bone.\n• The monsters you need to kill are mentioned on the wish list.",

Twenty waves need to be cleared, reaching wave 20 does not suffice.\n\nThe title can be unlocked on either a reward or trial run. If any of the previous titles (**the Abyssal**, **the Dark**, and **the Beast**) weren't unlocked yet, then those will be unlocked at the same time.\n\nRush of Blood is a weekly Slayer-themed combat [Distraction and Diversion](https://runescape.wiki/w/Distractions_and_Diversions) that can be played in [Prifddinas](https://runescape.wiki/w/Prifddinas). It is run by Morvran Iorwerth, slayer master and former warband leader, and takes place in [his dungeon](https://runescape.wiki/w/Morvran%27s_Dungeon) underneath the [Iorwerth Clan](https://runescape.wiki/w/Iorwerth_Clan) district. In the D&D, waves of different monsters, drawn from Morvran's assignment list, must be fought and one is given ten minutes to do so.\n\nThe timer does not begin until the player passes the barrier. A bank chest is available just outside of the arena, and can be accessed at any time. Doing so will not pause the timer. This means that use of the chest should be judged wisely.\n\n Players may utilize the [Rush of blood damage enhancer](https://runescape.wiki/w/Rush_of_blood_damage_enhancer), which gives a 10% damage boost.",

These can be uncovered by collecting 110 unique souls and depositing them into the chest at the center of the pyramid.\n\nThe [Slayer Codex](https://runescape.wiki/w/Slayer_Codex) is the book used to record the souls of Slayer monsters that the player has captured in an [Ushabti](https://runescape.wiki/w/Ushabti). It is obtained from [Faiza](https://runescape.wiki/w/Faiza) in the Sunken Pyramid after achieving level 99 Slayer. The Codex is updated when a new creature's soul is captured in an ushabti and placed in the [Chest of Souls](https://runescape.wiki/w/Chest_of_Souls), or when it is added to the player's personal [Slayer Dungeon](https://runescape.wiki/w/Sunken_Pyramid#Slayer_Dungeon).\n\nUshabti are containers used to trap the souls of Slayer monsters used to fill the Slayer Codex. A small number (25-50) are initially handed out by Faiza depending on Slayer level. Additional ushabti can be purchased from Slayer Masters for 20 [slayer points](https://runescape.wiki/w/Slayer_points) each, and are a possible reward from the [Rush of Blood](https://runescape.wiki/w/Rush_of_Blood) Distraction and Diversion (D&D) and the [Motherlode Maw](https://runescape.wiki/w/Motherlode_Maw).\n\nThe formula for the initial number of ushabti received appears to be 25 + 1 for each additional Slayer level over 99, or 50 at level 120 Slayer. If the free ushabti are claimed prior to having a max Slayer level, upon leveling, the player can still acquire more from Faiza.\n\n Souls can be removed from ushabti's if you accidently caught an undesired or duplicate soul.\n\nIt should be noted that you may not capture a soul from a creature in your own, or another player's, personal slayer dungeon.",

The Codex is updated when a new creature's soul is captured in an [Ushabti](https://runescape.wiki/w/Ushabti) and placed in the [Chest of Souls](https://runescape.wiki/w/Chest_of_Souls), or when it is added to the [Player's personal Slayer Dungeon](https://runescape.wiki/w/Sunken_Pyramid#Slayer_Dungeon).\n\nUshabti are containers used to trap the souls of Slayer monsters used to fill the Slayer Codex. A small number (25-50) are initially handed out by Faiza depending on Slayer level. Additional ushabti can be purchased from Slayer Masters for 20 [slayer points](https://runescape.wiki/w/Slayer_points) each, and are a possible reward from the [Rush of Blood](https://runescape.wiki/w/Rush_of_Blood) Distraction and Diversion (D&D) and the [Motherlode Maw](https://runescape.wiki/w/Motherlode_Maw).\n\nThe formula for the initial number of ushabti received appears to be 25 + 1 for each additional Slayer level over 99, or 50 at level 120 Slayer. If the free ushabti are claimed prior to having a max Slayer level, upon leveling, the player can still acquire more from Faiza.\n\n Souls can be removed from ushabti's if you accidently caught an undesired or duplicate soul.\n\nIt should be noted that you may not capture a soul from a creature in your own, or another player's, personal slayer dungeon.",
