All the guide channels are read-only, but we will be reposting them to amend any information or add new information as updates come. Muting every channel within a category will automatically hide the category from your view after the next time your Discord refreshes.\n\n• You can track the progress of all your achievements [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19sVmY1BgnRkuLIJANjf42IEvh83u_mYqf6PY0E5KXuk/edit?usp=sharing).
