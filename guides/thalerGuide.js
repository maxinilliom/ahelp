            "description": "[Thaler](https://runescape.wiki/w/Thaler) is a global [currency](https://runescape.wiki/w/Currencies) for [minigames](https://runescape.wiki/w/Minigames) that was released with the [Minigame Spotlight](https://runescape.wiki/w/Update:Minigame_Spotlight) system. It can be earned by playing any of the selected 14 minigames and is rewarded at a rate of 1 thaler every 5 minutes. In addition, a different minigame is spotlighted every three days to reward 1 thaler every minute.\n\nThe time for which thaler is awarded is rounded down at the end of a game. Any remainder is saved and added after a next game.\n\nPlayers may view the <#383761895871610880> channel to view the current and next 3 spotlights, or the [Minigame Spotlight Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=42brp3b48aumm199hord137gh0@group.calendar.google.com) for a three month view.\n\nIt is highly recommended to make friends throughout your AFK games so you can message one another to build teams when the spotlight changes to a more difficult spotlighted minigame.\n\nAchievement Help members may find an AFK Thaler community in this server. Users can tag the <@&446729279149965315> role for the current spotlight in order to find teams. You may join or leave this role by reacting to the :regional_indicator_v: emoji on the third to last message in the <#465998663710146579> channel.\n\nIt should be noted that playing Castle Wars is faster, though less AFK, than thaler. If you would like to obtain your goals through Castle Wars either in full, or partway, you may view the Castle Wars United consistent win community in the <#477196003989127168> channel.",

It is not worth playing on spotlight unless you organize a team through the AFK Thaler role tag as games end far too often on the official worlds. An alternative option is to play the game on the official worlds (53, 69) in order to gain thaler and [commendation points](https://runescape.wiki/w/Void_Knight_commendation_points) for [Elite Void Knight Equipment](https://runescape.wiki/w/Elite_Void_Knight_equipment)."

Griefers will often come and kill or steal your monster, however, the game requires 10+ players to begin so playing off world is unlikely."

As the hunted, you may be killed. Simply ignore players attempting to grief and enjoy the Thaler as the hunter or start a private game."

Games can last as long as each player would like them to. The official and spotlight worlds for this game are often empty, so you should find partners beforehand by asking around at other minigames. Every 30 minutes, you must move your piece at least one square to avoid being forced to forfeit. When you want to leave the game, simply ask your partner for a draw."

There is an activity bar on this game. To get around this, players may utilize an [attractor](https://runescape.wiki/w/Attractor_wand) on an orb within each map location without actually scoring to keep the activity level high. Since this is the only world it is played on, you may have legitimate players stealing your orb. If this occurs, its best to have the fellow AFKers in the match to join you on a different world. You will need a minimum of 3 other players to accomplish this. Another option is to attempt to coordinate so all the AFKers are on one team and players earning tokens to purchase the [Master runecrafter robes](https://runescape.wiki/w/Master_runecrafter_robes) are on the other team."
