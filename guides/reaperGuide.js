Players distribute themselves across the two sides or on one side of the arena, and defeat all 6 brothers at once in order to loot the reward chest.\n\nThe entrance to the minigame can be found west of the entrance to the Barrows, within a well that is surrounded by four outbuildings. It is marked on the minimap by a well icon (blue waterdrop).
