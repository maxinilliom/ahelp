It features a team of one to four players fighting against all six of the [Barrows Brothers](https://runescape.wiki/w/Barrows_brothers): [Ahrim](https://runescape.wiki/w/Barrows:_Rise_of_the_Six/Strategies#Ahrim_the_Blighted), [Dharok](https://runescape.wiki/w/Barrows:_Rise_of_the_Six/Strategies#Dharok_the_Wretched), [Guthan](https://runescape.wiki/w/Barrows:_Rise_of_the_Six/Strategies#Guthan_the_Infested), [Torag](https://runescape.wiki/w/Barrows:_Rise_of_the_Six/Strategies#Torag_the_Corrupted), [Verac](https://runescape.wiki/w/Barrows:_Rise_of_the_Six/Strategies#Verac_the_Defiled), and [Karil](https://runescape.wiki/w/Barrows:_Rise_of_the_Six/Strategies#Karil_the_Tainted). All six brothers, however, have been greatly enhanced by [Sliske](https://runescape.wiki/w/Sliske)'s experiments in the [Shadow Realm](https://runescape.wiki/w/Shadow_Realm), each increasing from level 150 and 12,000 life points to level 650 and 50,000 life points. Players distribute themselves across the two sides or on one side of the arena, and defeat all 6 brothers at once in order to loot the reward chest.\n\nThe entrance to the minigame can be found west of the entrance to the Barrows, within a well that is surrounded by four outbuildings. It is marked on the mini-map by a well icon (blue water-drop). The quickest way to get there is using [Drakan's medallion](https://runescape.wiki/w/Drakan%27s_medallion), which is unlocked during [the Branches of Darkmeyer](https://runescape.wiki/w/The_Branches_of_Darkmeyer). Teams of 4 can use the [Grouping System](https://runescape.wiki/w/Grouping_System), though one player must have a [Barrows totem](https://runescape.wiki/w/Barrows_totem) with them.",

This is very dangerous and makes Quintus possibly the most tedious to fight for inexperienced players as death is a much higher possibility due to limiting the player's space to avoid orb attacks, in addition to dealing much more damage than them.\n\nThe first and third lines he summons will run horizontally, while the second line runs vertically.\n\nStepping on one of these lines will deal incredibly heavy damage, more than the lighting strike in terms of individual damage. However, it only hits once if you step across the line. Unless using [Devotion](https://runescape.wiki/w/Devotion), you'll be forced to move to avoid being electrocuted by the lightning attack."

However, multiple pouches may be required as he can hit very hard and often against them. Despite this, Sextus is generally straightforward to kill, like Primus."
