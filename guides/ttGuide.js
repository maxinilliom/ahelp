The only permanent reward from the Mage Arena is unlocking the [Divine Storm](http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Divine_Storm) spell.\n\nPlayers can start the minigame by talking to [Kolodion](http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Kolodion), whom can be found by pulling the lever to the north-west of the Mage Arena (behind 2 webs).\n\nAfter defeating the last form of Kolodion, the player gains access to an underground area where they can buy the [God staves](http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/God_staves) or obtain their [God capes](http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/God_capes) by chosing 1 of the 3 [gods](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Gods).",

When you are fighting Kolodion, you are also not safe from PK'ers, however, it is a single-combat zone, so as long as you are fighting Kolodion, you should be fine. Regardless, it would be wise to complete this activity on a world with a low population, to minimize the chance of an encounter with a PK'er.\n\nThe best way to unlock the divine storm spell is to bring a magic wand, such as the [Avernic wand](http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Avernic_wand), due to unlimited [air runes](http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Air_rune) supply and the fact that wands have a much faster attack speed. The spell has to be cast atleast 100 times inside the Mage Arena to permanently unlock it."

The outfit can be obtained from the [The Raptor](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/The_Raptor)'s chest with the use of the [Raptor key](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Raptor_key). The key consists out of 4 pieces, each piece is dropped from one of the following slayer creatures:\n\n• The [Living Wyverns](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Wyvern) (for the [Raptor key part 1](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Raptor_key_part_1))\n• The [Ripper Demons](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Ripper_Demon) (for the [Raptor key part 2](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Raptor_key_part_2))\n• The [Camel Warriors](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Camel_Warrior) (for the [Raptor key part 3](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Raptor_key_part_3))\n• The [Acheron mammoths](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Acheron_mammoth) (for the [Raptor key part 4](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Raptor_key_part_4))\n\nEach key piece has a drop rate of 1/256. Once all four key parts are obtained, simply use one of the pieces on another. This will create the key, with a dialogue message stating 'You combine the four key parts into a reward key for the Raptor's chest of slaying'. The chest can be found right next to the [Burthorpe](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Burthorpe) bank.\n\nThe outfit has a 1/3 chance of being the prize upon opening, only if not already owned.",

When the Nymph appears, she will make a simple humming sound, so it is recommended to have the sound effects on high to hear her since it is a faint noise.\n\nIt is confirmed that the segment in which the player mines does not affect the appearance of the Nymph; it only affects the experience being earned. Mining in a world where no other players are present at the Lava Flow Mine will not increase the chances of encountering her.\n\nAfter she appears, the player has 5 minutes to talk to her to gain the reward before she disappears. Even if the 5 minutes aren't up, she will disappear upon logout and disconnection. Furthermore, if the mining site is left (i.e. if one were to get another pickaxe because their current one is already gilded), she will not be there on return.
