For maximum efficiency this method requires access to [Crystallise](https://runescape.wiki/w/Crystallise) and [Light Form](https://runescape.wiki/w/Light_Form) as well as completion of the medium set of [Tirannwn tasks](https://runescape.wiki/w/Tirannwn_achievements), which allows players to trap grenwalls without bait. It is useful to bring a [Bonecrusher](https://runescape.wiki/w/Bonecrusher) and [Herbicide](https://runescape.wiki/w/Herbicide) to convert some of the items received from hunting grenwalls into Prayer and Herblore experience. The use of [Demon Horn](https://runescape.wiki/w/Demon_horn_necklace), [Twisted Bird Skull](https://runescape.wiki/w/Twisted_bird_skull_necklace), or [Split Dragontooth Necklace](https://runescape.wiki/w/Split_dragontooth_necklace) in addition to a bonecrusher can restore the player's prayer points, removing the need to bring prayer potions for the use of Light Form although Prayer Renewals may still be needed especially at lower levels.
