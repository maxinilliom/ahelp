For maximum efficiency this method requires access to [Crystallise](http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Crystallise) and [Light Form](http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Light_Form) as well as completion of the medium set of [Tirannwn tasks](http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Tirannwn_achievements), which allows players to trap grenwalls without bait. It is useful to bring a [Bonecrusher](http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Bonecrusher) and [Herbicide](http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Herbicide) to convert some of the items received from hunting grenwalls into Prayer and Herblore experience.

Grenwalls can be found in three locations; at the [Gorajo Resource Dungeon](http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Gorajo_resource_dungeon) in [Meilyr Clan](http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Meilyr_Clan) requiring level 95 Dungeoneering, just south of the [Elf Camp](http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Elf_Camp) and at the the Grenwall Portal. Normally, laying a box trap takes 6 game ticks (3.6 seconds). If, however, you drink a potion and set the trap in the same tick, the trap will be set in just one tick.
