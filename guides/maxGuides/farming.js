The frequency of growth stage windows occurring is determined by the type of seed. For example, [spirit trees](https://runescape.wiki/w/Spirit_tree)' growth stages take 320 minutes, which includes a 5 minute growth window, followed by 315 minutes of inactivity, repeated multiple times. In comparison, [hops](https://runescape.wiki/w/Farming#Hops)' growth stages last 10 minutes, including 5 minutes of inactivity and a 5 minute growth stage window.\n\nThe cycles of growth stages all start at midnight game-time and repeat indefinitely until the next midnight when they begin again.

For many farming plots, compost reduces the chance of a player's crops becoming diseased while growing, as well as increasing the minimum amount of produce from the crops. It is recommended to use at least supercompost on every crop grown on their way to 99. Plots that have been treated with Ultracompost have a 7% chance of dying, half that of supercompost, which has a 14% chance."
