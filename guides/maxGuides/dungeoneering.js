For low Dungeoneering levels, it is recommended to solo.\n\n• Talk to the [Dungeoneering Tutor](https://runescape.wiki/w/Dungeoneering_tutor) by Daemonheim's entrance, he will give you a [Ring of Kinship](https://runescape.wiki/w/Ring_of_kinship).\n\n• Form a party by right clicking your ring of kinship and selecting **Open Party Interface** and click **Form Party**.\n\n• To start a dungeon after forming a party, click on the entrances that can be found on the left or right sides as soon as you enter the castle.\n\n• You will start on floor 1, complexity 1. You will be provided with some basic equipment. You may only bind one item at level 1 Dungeoneering.

That number increases with a higher Dungeoneering level. Bound items cannot be traded, sold, or alchemized, and to unbind an item is to destroy it permanently.

To get around this many players rush through lower floors in quick succession as fast as possible by setting the lowest complexity possible, disregarding the amount of experience they receive on these floors in order to tick off all floors as quickly as possible.

Dying can have big experience penalties, ranging between 4% and 70%. Players can die up to 15 times, with any deaths after 15 not negatively counting against the players, so it is ideal to avoid dying whenever you can.\n\n• Players should familiarize themselves with Dungeoneering abbreviations found [here](https://runescape.wiki/w/Dungeoneering/Abbreviations).\n\n• Players can self-assign the role **Dungeoneering Team** in the <#465998663710146579> channel or look for teams on World 77."
