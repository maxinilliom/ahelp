You will be provided with some equipment. You may only bind one item at level 1 Dungeoneering.

    "description": "• Go to the deepest floor as you can with the Dungeoneering level you have and reset prestige when you have done all the floors you can. \n\n •It is advised to get the highest tier of pickaxes and hatchets you can possibly obtain (even if you do not have the required level to use it, since they automatically become the highest tier your skill can use until you can use their true tier) to add to your Dungeoneering tool belt as early as possible. This will enable you to obtain resources faster and will also last you for other floors. For example, somebody with 76 Mining can add a primal pickaxe to their tool belt, as the primal pickaxe will act as the highest tier pickaxe you can use - in this case, tier 8. \n\n • ```Party with people like you```: It is always a good idea to group up with people near your combat level and with similar skill levels. This ensures that the monsters in the dungeon and skill requirements will not be too hard for any one person. Also, you should be able to agree on how you progress through a dungeon, killing everything, skilling all the way or rushing.",

Complexity 6 has no experience penalty, complexity 5 has a 30% experience penalty, and each complexity thereafter has another 5% penalty, all the way down to 50% penalty for complexity 1. Difficulty won't give a penalty unless there is a large range in player levels, but can give a big bonus for sometimes little work. Additionally, using a lower complexity and difficulty actually carries a much larger penalty than the 30%-50% modifier that you see.

Dying can have big experience penalties (between 4% and 70%, you can die up to 15 times, any deaths after 15 don't count) so it is ideal to avoid dying whenever you can. However, with that said, teams of intermediate and more experienced dungeoneerers will generally grow quite angry with people hoarding food and avoiding dangerous rooms/running away in the middle of combat in order to avoid death at all costs. These people are known as \"survival prods\" and are generally an annoyance and slow down floor times greatly. In order to obtain the best possible experience rates per hour, it is a better strategy to take one or two deaths per floor and save the 5 minutes it would take to return to base, gather food materials, cook food etc, and then resume combat."

If you see a key, pick it up so that everyone has access to it and open any doors you see. Don't go into a room if they say 'de', its a dead end you don't have to explore. If a team member asks you to make them some armour, ask them to get you the materials, and vice versa. If someone needs food and they're out, do some good and feed them some of yours. All this can speed up a run through the dungeon. However, in certain situations, devoting too much time to skilling can slow down the floor significantly."

You may find that by levelling your other skills dungeons will progress faster, as you have access to more resources and methods of obtaining them, giving you better armour, food, and familiars. It is also advised to keep your skills fairly even; at 80 woodcutting, you'll be getting corpsethorn and entgallow trees, but if your Fletching and/or Firemaking isn't up to the levels for these trees, you will usually be forced to buy them from the smuggler, or ask your teammates for some help. Also be aware that your teammates levels are incorporated into the dungeon, and if their levels are higher than yours, you may find yourself surrounded by resources you can't use, let alone gather."
