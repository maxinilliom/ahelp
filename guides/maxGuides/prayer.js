The experience you gain depends upon the type of bone you are burying or ash you are scattering. \n\nOne of the most used methods is offering bones at a [Gilded Altar](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Gilded_altar) with 2 lit [Marble Burners](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Marble_burners) in the [Chapel](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Chapel) of a [player-owned house](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Player-owned_house). Building this requires a Construction level of 75, but you can also visit someone else's house and use their altar.\n\nOffering bones or ashes at a gilded altar with 2 lit marble burners will give you 350% of the original experience:\n• [Impious ashes](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Impious_ashes): 14 experience\n• [Normal bones](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Bones): 15.75 experience\n• [Accursed ashes](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Accursed_ashes): 43.75 experience\n• [Big bones](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Big_bones): 52.5 experience\n• [Babydragon bones](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Babydragon_bones): 105 experience\n• [Wyvern bones](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Wyvern_bones): 175 experience\n• [Infernal ashes](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Infernal_ashes): 218.75 experience\n• [Dragon bones](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Dragon_bones): 252 experience\n• [Dagannoth bones](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Dagannoth_bones): 437.5 experience\n• [Airut bones](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Airut_bones): 463.75 experience\n• [Ourg bones](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Ourg_bones_%28General_Graardor%29): 490 experience\n• [Hardened dragon bones](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Hardened_dragon_bones): 504 experience\n• [Frost dragon bones](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Frost_dragon_bones): 630 experience\n• [Reinforced dragon bones](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Reinforced_dragon_bones): 665 experience\n• [Searing ashes](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Searing_ashes): 700 experience",

Although the process is slower than just burying the bones, the experience earned is far better than just by burying the bones. To make the use of the ectofuntus most efficiently, it is best to use ashes instead of bones because ashes do not need to be ground first.\n\nIn comparison to using bones on a gilded altar, the Ectofuntus will give ~14% more experience per bone/ash, but it can be slower.

Use the bone grinder to grind the bones and collect the crushed bones. To activate the \"grinder\", right click \"Fill Hopper\", which will automatically start the process of grinding all bones in your inventory and collecting them, one at a time (if the grinder is set to auto).

      "description":"A temporary skill boost is anything caused by an item, Summoning familiar, or action that temporarily raises a player's level in one or more skills. If the boost is visible, it allows the player to do things above their current level. If the boost is invisible, you won't be able to do things above their current level. However, it is possible to combine a visible and invisible boost, in which case the visible boost will work first, followed by the invisible boost.",
