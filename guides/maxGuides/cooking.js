Each range lasts 5 minutes once placed and can either be purchased from the [Grand Exchange](http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Grand_Exchange) or obtained from Treasure Hunter. You can usually find a portable range being hosted somewhere, usually on world 84 at the [Combat Academy](http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Combat_Academy) in [Lumbridge](http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Lumbridge), north of the castle by the bank chest. This allows you to cook on the range without even moving from the spot in front of the bank chest."
