This can make combination runecrafting somewhat expensive as some talismans have fairly high prices (such as water talismans). The Lunar spell Magic Imbue, which requires level 82 Magic, allows players to craft combination runes without need of a talisman. In addition, each rune has only a 50% chance of being successfully created. A binding necklace raises this chance to 100%, although the necklace is destroyed after 15 uses."
