Since the waterfall is located in [Prifddinas](https://runescape.wiki/w/Prifddinas), completion of the [Plague's End](https://runescape.wiki/w/Plague%27s_End) quest is required. The waterfall is located between the [Crwys](https://runescape.wiki/w/Crwys) and [Meilyr](https://runescape.wiki/w/Meilyr) districts.\n\nPlayers will also need level 90 Ranged, Agility, and Strength to be able to use the [grapple shortcut](https://runescape.wiki/w/Agility#Grapple_shortcuts) to reach the top of the waterfall. To use the grapple shortcut, you will need to bring a [mithril grapple](https://runescape.wiki/w/Mithril_grapple) and a [crossbow](https://runescape.wiki/w/Crossbow), have an [enhanced grappling hook](https://runescape.wiki/w/Enhanced_grappling_hook) on your [tool belt](https://runescape.wiki/w/Tool_belt), or have built the [hidey-hole](https://runescape.wiki/w/Hidey-hole) at the shortcut.\n\nAt level 93 fishing, you will only be able to catch [small crystal urchins](https://runescape.wiki/w/Small_crystal_urchin) at the low-level area, giving 310 experience. All the urchins stack so you won't need to bank or empty your inventory to continue fishing.\n\nAt level 95 Fishing, you will also be able to catch [medium crystal urchins](https://runescape.wiki/w/Medium_crystal_urchin), giving 330 experience, and [large crystal urchins](https://runescape.wiki/w/Large_crystal_urchin), giving 350 experience, at 97 Fishing.\n\nAll urchins can be used to buy rewards or experience from the [Prifddinas Waterfall Fishing Shop](https://runescape.wiki/w/Prifddinas_Waterfall_Fishing_Shop), or can be ground into [harmony dust](https://runescape.wiki/w/Harmony_dust) to be used in [perfect juju fishing potions](https://runescape.wiki/w/Perfect_juju_fishing_potion).",
