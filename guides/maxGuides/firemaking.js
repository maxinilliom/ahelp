Firemaking experience is also granted after adding the evil tree kindling to the bonfire from the dead evil tree."

Each trick has a recommended Firemaking level to attempt, however the level is not required in order to perform the trick, as it is possible to succeed or fail a trick at any Firemaking level. When a trick is performed that has a higher recommended Firemaking level than the player has, the experience received will be the same as that given for performing a trick with half the recommended Firemaking level, rounded down."
