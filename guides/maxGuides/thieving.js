Around 6,000 experience an hour can be gained from this method with level 1-5 Thieving. However, as only 388 experience is needed to achieve level 5 Thieving, players with no previous experience of the skill should achieve level 5 in approximately 4 minutes. Pompous merchants are found in [Taverley](http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Taverley), just east of the lodestone. Players will gain a few coins each time that they successfully pickpocket a merchant but will lose some life points and be stunned for several seconds if their pickpocketing attempt is unsuccessful.",

When stealing from stalls in general, players should stand on the opposite side of the bakery stall to any market guards or guards present in the area; otherwise these NPCs will attack the player when they attempt to steal from the stall.\n\nEach successful theft from bakery stalls will randomly yield bread, cake, a chocolate slice, or a chocolate bar. After an item has been stolen from the stall, the player must wait for the shop stall's stock to replenish before they can steal from the stall again. The best bakery stall location for training is at the [Catherby](http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Catherby) (south of the bank). There is a spot behind the stall that can hide players from the lone guard. This is the same for [Taverley](http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Taverley) marketplace although it is further from a bank. [East Ardougne](http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/East_Ardougne) also has bakery stalls, but the high density of guards means that the player will suffer more frequent interruptions and thus lower experience rates.",
