    "description": "Construction is a members-only artisan skill that allows players to build and customise their very own [player-owned house](https://runescape.wiki/w/Player-owned_house) (POH). Players design their house by arranging various square rooms and then filling them with furniture specific to the type of room, giving experience in the process. It should be noted that while training construction, players will need to repeatedly build something and then immediately remove it in order to build it again for additional expiernce, unless a [flatpack](https://runescape.wiki/w/Flatpack) is being used. With this, players should wait until their final levels or experience goals have been met to build their house up to their desired end product status.\n\nAs players achieve higher levels, more types of rooms and better room features become available.\n\n The following list of topics will explain how Construction works in a little more detail.",
