The recommended method is to buy an equal amount of [copper ore](https://runescape.wiki/w/Copper_ore) and [tin ore](https://runescape.wiki/w/Tin_ore) from the [Grand Exchange](https://runescape.wiki/w/Grand_Exchange). Using a [furnace](https://runescape.wiki/w/Furnace), smelt the ores into bronze bars and then sell these back on the Grand Exchange. Many players choose to smith in the [Artisan's Workshop](https://runescape.wiki/w/Artisans%27_Workshop), especially on world 70, for the added bonus of [luminite injectors](https://runescape.wiki/w/Luminite_injector).\n\nIt is recommended to have enough money for an initial investment of around 50,000 gold pieces, but it is possible to do this method with under 1,000 gold pieces as starting money. This method of smithing will make a profit.",
