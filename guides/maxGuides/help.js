To do this, you must utilize the prefix, which in this case is a period, followed by the guide section you are looking in and the achievement or guide you are looking for.\n\n• .max <skill> help - Provides a list of all available commands to use for that skill.\n\n• .max <skill> <section> - Provides the guide for the given section.\n\nNote that <> is not needed in any part of the command. All guides can be found by giving a shortened version of that name. If the command has no other identical command counterparts, the guide will directly spawn. If it does, a list of options for you to choose from with its corresponding number will spawn. [Example](https://gyazo.com/31aa9f30ff4f0fc571899c3604e3b13f)."

[Example](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/398504241305747466/490198657111425042/unknown.png).\n\n• You can also mute channels by right-clicking them and selecting mute. All the guide channels are read-only, but we will be reposting them to amend any information or add new information as updates come. Muting every channel within a category will automatically hide the category from your view after the next time your Discord refreshes.\n\n• You can track the progress of all your achievements [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19sVmY1BgnRkuLIJANjf42IEvh83u_mYqf6PY0E5KXuk/edit?usp=sharing). You will need to select **File** > **Make a copy..** in order to edit the sheet to your own achievement completion status."
