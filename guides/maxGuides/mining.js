    "description": "At level 1 Mining, players should begin training by mining [rune essence](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Rune_essence). Rune essence can only be found at the [Rune Essence mine](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Rune_Essence_mine), which players can access using the right-click teleport options on [Aubury](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Aubury) in Varrock; [Archmage Sedridor](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Archmage_Sedridor) in Wizards' Tower; or [Carwen Essencebinder](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Carwen_Essencebinder) in Burthorpe. At level 30 Mining members will begin to mine [pure essence](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Pure_essence) instead of rune essence, though this gives the same experience as mining rune essence. One should only use a [bronze pickaxe](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Bronze_pickaxe) here as higher-tier pickaxes have a negative affect on your mining rate. Equipping a bronze pickaxe will ensure that this is used instead of any higher level pickaxe that the player may have stored in their [tool belt](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Tool_belt). Using a bronze pickaxe the player may gain around 26,000 experience an hour, meaning level 30 will take just over half an hour and level 50 will take just under 4 hours. This experience rate is gained at any Mining level when mining either rune or pure essence with a bronze pickaxe. \n\nPlayers should put rune/pure essence on their action bar and keybind that spot in order to more conveniently drop the essence. Holding down the key will drop essence without stopping your mining, allowing for uninterrupted experience gain as your inventory will not fill up.",

The Legends' Guild mining site contains grizzly bears which are aggressive towards players with a combat level of 64 or lower.

On completion of the quest, the amulet gives 500 bonus experience to players for either Mining or Smithing. However, this amount can be significantly increased by completing the tasks [Doric](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Doric) and [Boric](https://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Boric) assign to the player after the quest, up to a total of 183,500 bonus experience. These extra tasks can only be done by members. Completing every task requires 60 mining and 75 smithing."
